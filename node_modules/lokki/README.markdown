# Lokki - A Prototype MVC framework using Express.js for node.js

A Rails inspired MVC attempt on the top of Express.js for Node.js !
Please note that this is a very primitive attempt to create a MVC framework for node.js using express.js.

I am not a pro javascript coder, so please pardon my erratic style of coding.

And yes, this library needs documentation on how it works, I`ll get 'em up soon.

## Dependency

Express 2.x is required.

Express.JS ([express.js](http://expressjs.com)) for more information about
this amazing web framework for Node.js

## MVC Code Reference

I would like to thank TJ Holowaychuk ([visionmedia](http://github.com/visionmedia)) for providing an 
amazing example and a starting point for me to extend his MVC architecture based example into
a working framework prototype using Express.js. 

You can refer to his MVC example using Express.js ([here](https://github.com/visionmedia/express/tree/master/examples/mvc))
